						As the Pacific Northwest stands still, waiting in our homes for Covid to pass over, music has remained one positive constant.  The community power of our local <a href="https://www.kexp.org/" target="_blank">KEXP</a> (the best damned radio station in the world) and its incredible DJs have provided hope, energy, and an amazing soundtrack during this bizarre time.  In particular, the morning DJ <a href="https://www.kexp.org/djs/john-richards/" target="_blank">John Richards</a> leads the charge each day with his honest emotional connections and top-quality music taste.

						In appreciation of KEXP, I created a version of the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_Save_the_Queen_(Sex_Pistols_song)" target="_blank">Sex Pistols "God Save the Queen"</a> cover dedicated to the work of our beloved DJs.  I gave John the place of honor, replacing Queen Elizabeth II with his likeness.

						The work of this Create*52 was twofold: the portrait and the layout.  To give John the old-school printing style seen in the original God Save the Queen cover, I used Adobe Photoshop's mode tools to reduce the colors to a duotone, then convert the image to a bitmap for a reduced quality look.

						Once I had the look of John's likeness in the Queen's style, the rest was placement, color, and fonts.  The cover uses a central oval to contain its content - made easy using Photoshop's mask system.  Color overlay effects allowed me to assign the blue and off-white to the darks and lights respectively.  Finally, the classic cut-and-paste method enabled me to use most of the same font from the original cover.  The message is clear: God Save the Music!
