						Texture Trail is an exploration in digital painting using <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/fresco.html" target="_blank">Adobe Fresco</a>.  Fresco is interesting because it includes "live" brushes in both watercolors and oil "paints".  This piece was created using a variety of digital oil brushes.

						This was my first real project in Fresco, and the first time I've digitally painted anything in over a decade.  It was fascinating to play with the various brushes, and extremely fun to progress through the painting with all of the power Fresco provides.
					</p>
					<p>
						One thing I found especially satisfying is the way that Fresco emulates the physical nature of oil paint.  I found myself mesmerized by the various way I could "shape" the digital oil.  This comes through in the various textures on the canvas.

						For this project I "cheated" by using a digital photo as a base for the painting.  This made the color selection and composition easier.  I also took the original photo, and so I feel even more connected to this special photograph now that I have examined every aspect of it in detail.  The experience was cathartic, and reminded me of the soothing benefits of coloring books.
					</p>
					<p>
						I learned a lot about Fresco and digital paint during this experience, and I am looking forward to my next opportunity with this software.
