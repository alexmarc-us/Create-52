					<h1>Five: Kris 2020</h1>
					<p>
						My friend Kris is running for Class President of his nursing school, so I offered to help with any graphics he might need.  We met at the <a href="http://boatshed.restaurant/">Boat Shed</a> and discussed his vision over Arnold Palmers.

						Kris wanted a campaign flyer, as well as stickers that he could wrap around clever medical pens and hand out.  We workshopped his message and landed on one of hope for his fellow students: "Together We Succeed".  We also did some rough sketching for the general layout of the flyer.  From the beginning, it was clear that we were going for a fun and engaging look.

						Once we had established a plan, I got to work in Photoshop and Illustrator creating the flyer.  We ran through a number of iterations, working back and forth on layout, fonts, and colors to come a final revision.  The result was even more hilarious than we imagined!

						The last step was to take elements from the flyer and shrink them down to a sticker size.  Again, these stickers will be wrapped around pens, so I only had 1.25"x1.25" to work with.
